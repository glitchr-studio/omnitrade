# glitchr/omnitrade

One contract for payment providers and commerce platforms - the Omnibus of trade.

```php
$gateway = $registry->get('card');
$transaction = $gateway->purchase($payment);   // PAID, or PENDING with the page to send the buyer to
$gateway->fetch($transaction->reference);      // where it stands now
$gateway->refund($transaction->reference, Money::of(500, 'EUR'), idempotencyKey: 'refund-42');
$gateway->notify($request->getContent(), $request->headers->all());   // a webhook, checked and read

$page = $gateway->fetchProducts(updatedSince: $lastSync);   // the platform's catalogue, page by page
$gateway->fetchProduct('https://cave.example/products/margaux-2019');   // by id or by its page
$gateway->fetchInventory();                                  // stock levels, where the platform counts them

$gateway->affiliateLink('https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0C1234567');   // the product's address with the site's tag

$account = $gateway->createAccount('FR', 'host@example.org');   // a connected account (Stripe Connect, Express)
$gateway->accountLink($account->reference, $return, $refresh);  // where its holder completes it
$gateway->subscribe($payment, 'month');                         // a subscription, on the provider's page
```

The catalogue (`Product`, `ProductVariant`, `Offer`, `Stock`, `Media`, `Option`, `Merchant`)
and the affiliate links are described in [docs/catalogue.md](docs/catalogue.md), connected
accounts and payments for someone else (`Payment::$destination`, `::$applicationFee`) in
[docs/connect.md](docs/connect.md), subscriptions in [docs/subscriptions.md](docs/subscriptions.md).

This package holds the contract (`GatewayInterface`, `GatewayFactory`, `Registry`), the models
(`Payment`, `Money`, `Transaction`, `Refund`, `PaymentMethod`, `Notification`, `PlatformOrder`,
`Product`, `ProductVariant`, `Offer`, `Stock`...),
the requests and a bridge for Symfony. It needs no framework: it requires nothing but
`symfony/http-client-contracts`, each provider package `symfony/http-client`. Each provider is a
package of its own:

| Package | Provider |
|---|---|
| `omnitrade/stripe` | Stripe: Checkout sessions, refunds, webhooks (on omnipay/stripe); its Products and Prices; Connect (Express accounts, destination charges); subscriptions |
| `omnitrade/paypal` | PayPal: orders, capture, refunds, webhooks (on omnipay/paypal) |
| `omnitrade/shopify` | Shopify: draft orders paid on the invoice page, orders, the catalogue and inventory, webhooks (Admin GraphQL) |
| `omnitrade/woocommerce` | WooCommerce: orders and their payment state, the catalogue and stock (REST API v3) |
| `omnitrade/web` | Any product page, read from its own markup (JSON-LD, microdata, OpenGraph); affiliate links by host |
| `omnitrade/amazon` | Amazon: products through the Creators API, affiliate links with the partner tag |

A provider's factory fills a `Config` - its name, options, API client and actions - and the
gateway runs the actions that support each request, exactly as an Omnibus carrier does. A
provider that does not do something (no authorizations at Shopify) throws
`RequestNotSupportedException`; `supports()` says so beforehand.

What every provider answers with is kept whole in `$raw`: normalization loses nothing.

## Plain PHP

```sh
composer require glitchr/omnitrade omnitrade/paypal
```

```php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Omnitrade\Model\Money;
use Omnitrade\Model\Payment;
use Omnitrade\PayPal\PayPalGatewayFactory;
use Omnitrade\Registry;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$registry = new Registry([new PayPalGatewayFactory(HttpClient::create())], [
    'paypal' => ['factory' => 'paypal', 'options' => ['client_id' => '...', 'secret' => '...', 'sandbox' => true]],
]);

$transaction = $registry->get('paypal')->purchase(new Payment(amount: Money::of(1250, 'EUR'), reference: 'ORDER-1042', returnUrl: 'https://shop.example/retour'));
$transaction->isRedirect() && header('Location: '.$transaction->redirectUrl);   // PayPal's page; capture() when the buyer is back
```

A factory takes the HTTP client to call with - the application's, a `MockHttpClient` in a test -
and makes its own when given none. A whole script that runs as it is, and the rest:
[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md). No class of a framework is loaded on the way:
`Tests/BareTest.php` checks it in a process of its own, and so does
`docker compose run --rm omnitrade bare` ([docs/harness.md](docs/harness.md)).

## Symfony

In a Symfony application a bundle does the wiring; its components (`symfony/config`,
`symfony/dependency-injection`, `symfony/http-kernel`) are not required by this package: the
application has them ([docs/symfony.md](docs/symfony.md)).
`Omnitrade\Bridge\Symfony\OmnitradeBundle`: every `omnitrade/*` provider installed registered,
`Omnitrade\Registry` autowired, and each configured gateway injectable by its name.

```yaml
omnitrade:
    gateways:
        card:   { factory: stripe, options: { api_key: '%env(STRIPE_API_KEY)%', webhook_secret: '%env(STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)%' } }
        paypal: { factory: paypal, options: { client_id: '%env(PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID)%', secret: '%env(PAYPAL_SECRET)%', sandbox: true } }
```

```php
public function __construct(GatewayInterface $card) {}
```

An application's own `GatewayFactoryInterface` is registered too (autoconfigured).

## Docker: every provider with your test keys

`docker/` runs this package with every `omnitrade/*` provider installed - from GitHub, or from the
checkouts beside this one when `OMNITRADE_PLUGINS=../..` is set - and a console that exercises
them with the keys in `docker/.env` (copy `.env.dist`; `docker compose run --rm omnitrade gateways`
says which providers are configured and what each one does):

```sh
cd docker && cp .env.dist .env
docker compose run --rm omnitrade gateways
docker compose run --rm omnitrade purchase stripe --amount 1990      # prints the Checkout page to open
docker compose run --rm omnitrade fetch stripe cs_test_...
docker compose run --rm omnitrade refund stripe cs_test_... --amount 500
docker compose run --rm omnitrade notify stripe -H 'Stripe-Signature: t=...,v1=...' < event.json
docker compose run --rm omnitrade catalogue shopify --since='-1 day' --limit=20   # products, variants, prices, stock
docker compose run --rm omnitrade catalogue woocommerce --query=margaux --cursor=2
docker compose run --rm omnitrade catalogue shopify --product=https://shop.example/products/margaux --inventory
docker compose run --rm omnitrade catalogue woocommerce --inventory                # every variant's stock
docker compose run --rm omnitrade bare --recorded                    # plain PHP: no bundle, no container, and what PHP loaded
docker compose run --rm omnitrade test                               # every package's tests
```
