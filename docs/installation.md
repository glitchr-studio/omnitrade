# Installation and first calls

```sh
composer require glitchr/omnitrade omnitrade/paypal            # one provider
composer require omnitrade/stripe omnitrade/shopify omnitrade/woocommerce omnitrade/web omnitrade/amazon
```

PHP 8.2 or later.

Omnitrade needs no framework. The core requires nothing but `symfony/http-client-contracts`, each
provider package `symfony/http-client`: two libraries that stand alone. It runs the same in plain
PHP, in a worker, in Laravel or Slim, and in Symfony, where a bundle does the wiring
([Symfony](symfony.md)).

`omnitrade/stripe` stands on [Omnipay](https://omnipay.thephpleague.com) (`omnipay/stripe`), a
library with no framework either; Omnipay's own requirements come with it, `symfony/http-foundation`
among them - used as a library for its request object: no kernel, no container.

## Plain PHP

```php
<?php // bare.php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Omnitrade\Model\Customer;
use Omnitrade\Model\Line;
use Omnitrade\Model\Money;
use Omnitrade\Model\Payment;
use Omnitrade\PayPal\PayPalGatewayFactory;
use Omnitrade\Registry;
use Omnitrade\Request\Authorize;
use Omnitrade\Request\FetchProducts;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\MockHttpClient;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\Response\MockResponse;

// The HTTP client the providers call with: in an application, HttpClient::create(). Here, one that
// answers as PayPal's sandbox does (its documentation's example order), so that the script runs as
// it is, without an account.
$http = new MockHttpClient(static fn (string $method, string $url) => new MockResponse(json_encode(match (parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH)) {
    '/v1/oauth2/token' => ['access_token' => 'paypal_test_not_a_real_token', 'expires_in' => 32400],
    '/v2/checkout/orders' => ['id' => '5O190127TN364715T', 'status' => 'PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED', 'links' => [
        ['rel' => 'payer-action', 'href' => 'https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=5O190127TN364715T'],
    ]],
})));

$registry = new Registry([new PayPalGatewayFactory($http)], [
    'paypal' => ['factory' => 'paypal', 'options' => ['client_id' => 'paypal_test_not_a_real_client_id', 'secret' => 'paypal_test_not_a_real_secret', 'sandbox' => true]],
]);
$gateway = $registry->get('paypal');

var_dump($gateway->supports(Authorize::class), $gateway->supports(FetchProducts::class));   // what it does, said beforehand

$transaction = $gateway->purchase(new Payment(
    amount: Money::of(1250, 'EUR'),                       // minor units
    reference: 'ORDER-1042',
    description: 'Commande n° 1042',
    customer: new Customer(email: 'camille@example.org', name: 'Camille Durand', country: 'FR'),
    lines: [new Line('Dix heures', Money::of(1250, 'EUR'))],
    returnUrl: 'https://shop.example/retour',
    cancelUrl: 'https://shop.example/panier',
    idempotencyKey: 'attempt-1',
));

echo $transaction->provider, ' ', $transaction->reference, ' ', $transaction->status->value, "\n";
if ($transaction->isRedirect()) {
    echo 'send the buyer to ', $transaction->redirectUrl, "\n";   // then capture() when they are back
}
```

```
$ php bare.php
bool(true)
bool(false)
paypal 5O190127TN364715T pending
send the buyer to https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=5O190127TN364715T
```

(run on 2026-10-05 in an empty directory, after `composer require glitchr/omnitrade omnitrade/paypal`;
every provider asks for an account's keys, so the script answers in PayPal's place, with the order
id of PayPal's own documentation. With `HttpClient::create()` and a sandbox application's client id
and secret, the same lines create a real sandbox order.)

That is all there is to it:

- a **factory** per provider package (`StripeGatewayFactory`, `PayPalGatewayFactory`,
  `ShopifyGatewayFactory`, `WooCommerceGatewayFactory`, `WebGatewayFactory`,
  `AmazonGatewayFactory`), which takes the HTTP client to call with - the application's, a
  `MockHttpClient` in a test; with none given it makes its own (`HttpClient::create()`);
- the **registry**, built by hand from the factories and the gateways' options, by name: `get()`,
  and `create($name, $overrides)` for keys typed in a back office;
- the **gateways** it gives - `purchase()`, `authorize()`, `capture()`, `refund()`, `void()`,
  `fetch()`, `notify()`, `fetchProducts()`, `fetchProduct()`, `fetchInventory()`,
  `affiliateLink()`... - the same for every provider; `supports()` says beforehand what one does.

No class of a framework is loaded on the way - a test of this package checks it in a process of
its own (`Tests/BareTest.php`), and so does `docker compose run --rm omnitrade bare`
([harness](harness.md)).

## After the buyer is back

```php
$paid = $gateway->capture($transaction->reference, idempotencyKey: 'attempt-1');   // PayPal: the money is taken now
$paid->isPaid();

$gateway->fetch($transaction->reference);                                          // where it stands now
$gateway->refund($transaction->reference, Money::of(500, 'EUR'), idempotencyKey: 'refund-42');
```

## A webhook

```php
use Omnitrade\Exception\InvalidNotificationException;

try {
    $notification = $gateway->notify(file_get_contents('php://input'), getallheaders());   // checked against its signature, then read
} catch (InvalidNotificationException) {
    http_response_code(400);
    exit;
}
```

## A product page, no key

```php
use Omnitrade\Web\WebGatewayFactory;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$web = (new WebGatewayFactory(HttpClient::create()))->create(['affiliate' => ['amazon.fr' => ['tag' => 'mysite-21']]]);

$product = $web->fetchProduct('https://shop.example/products/margaux-2019');   // from its JSON-LD, microdata or OpenGraph
$product?->title; $product?->price(); $product?->media;
$web->affiliateLink('https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0C1234567');                    // the address with the site's tag
```

## In a framework

- **Symfony**: `Omnitrade\Bridge\Symfony\OmnitradeBundle` registers the factories on the
  application's `http_client`, builds the registry from `config/packages/omnitrade.yaml` and makes
  each gateway injectable by its name: see [Symfony](symfony.md). Its components
  (`symfony/config`, `symfony/dependency-injection`, `symfony/http-kernel`) are not required by
  this package: a Symfony application has them.
- **Any other**: build the `Registry` once, where the framework builds its services (a service
  provider, a container definition), as the script above does.

## Errors

| Exception | When |
|---|---|
| `RequestNotSupportedException` | the provider does not do that (no authorizations at Shopify): `supports()` says so beforehand |
| `InvalidConfigException` | a gateway not configured, a factory not installed, an option missing |
| `InvalidNotificationException` | a webhook whose signature does not hold |
| `ProviderException` | the provider refused, or could not be reached |

All implement `Omnitrade\Exception\OmnitradeException`.
